# Research Portfolio

A few examples of my research work in different forms (abstract, PowerPoint
slides, and poster presentation).  

The slidedeck here is the one I used to present
at the CSTEP statewide STEM conference and won "honorable mention" (2nd place)
for best oral presentation in the natural sciences division. 

A couple notes about the slidedeck:
- the protein animations are only visible if the slidedeck is opened in PowerPoint.
- there are talking points in each slide.


Thank you for checking it out!
